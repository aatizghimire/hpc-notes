Using C Language, is best for using hardware, since it is mid-level programming language, which is relatively fast and also used for managing our own memory. We can also use fortan, but i found it diffcult to implement, but there are great resource for that. I also tried to include C++ codes examples.

For Multi-threading and OpenMP, we need to use GCC Compiler and for CUDA code to be compiled we need NVCC Compiler.
