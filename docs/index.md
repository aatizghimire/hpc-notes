# Welcome to High Performance Computing

## Introduction
High Performance Computing, is maximum utilization of resource in an computer system. Here, we try to  divide task/ job into multiple CPUs/GPUs in parallel (concurrent) ways. I expected readers, that they understand basic computer architecture and basic working of Operating System.

Prequisite: None
